  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to CrackedRuby</h1>

  <p class="mb-4">
    This website covers various Computer Science and Web Development topics that are frequently looked at through a Ruby colored lens.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    My name is Tom Swokowski (<a href="https://x.com/tomswokowski" class="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tomswokowski</a>)
    and this site is a personal space where I share and experiment with random things I’m interested in.
    It’ll be rough around the edges for a while, and things aren’t guaranteed to work properly all the time.
    I thought it’d be fun to watch this site come to life over time instead of crossing every “t” and dotting every “i”
    before getting it live. Although, the more technical pieces of information are more carefully produced and are
    accurate to the best of my knowledge despite any temporary cosmetic deficiencies.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">A couple more things:</h2>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why this site?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I’m making this site to express my passion as a software developer and to share my ideas with other like-minded individuals.
    I’m also a believer that one of the best ways to get better at something is to try and explain it clearly so that even a novice
    can understand. My goal is to become a better developer, so building complex features for this site is a good way to achieve this.
    I may even have some fun along the way.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Ruby?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    “Ruby is dead and there are no jobs that use it” has been a fairly common sentiment online for at least the last 10 years.
    Those two points may or may not have merit, but Ruby is the best programming language for me currently for a single important reason.
    That reason is because it gets me to keep coming back and wanting to open my computer to read and write it.
    I don’t feel any other reason or justification is needed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Is this site just AI slop?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Every word on this website is genuinely written by me. Unless it’s contextually obvious,
    I’ll be radically transparent if there is any AI generated text present.
    Certain features will be “vibe coded” when appropriate (ie: boilerplate Social Login functionality).
    The goal is to implement features that are beyond the current capabilities of LLMs.
    Otherwise, what is even the point? A curious viewer can check out the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomswokowski/crackedruby" class="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code</a>,
    which is completely public.
