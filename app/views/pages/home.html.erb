  <h1 class="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Welcome to CrackedRuby</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
    This website covers various Computer Science and Web Development topics that are frequently looked at through a Ruby-colored lens.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    My name is Tom Swokowski (<a href="https://x.com/tomswokowski" class="underline text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tomswokowski</a>).
    This site is a personal space where I share and experiment with random things I’m interested in.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">A couple more things:</h2>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why this site?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I’m making this site to express my passion as a software developer and to share my ideas with other like-minded individuals.
    I also believe that working on complex features that stretch my current ability is the best way to become a better developer.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Ruby?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Ruby gets me to keep coming back and wanting to open my computer to read and write it.
    I don’t feel any other reason or justification is needed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Is this site just AI slop?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Every word on this website is genuinely written by me. Unless it’s contextually obvious,
    I’ll be radically transparent if there is any AI-generated text present. A curious viewer can check out the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomswokowski/crackedruby" class="underline text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code</a>,
    which is completely public.
